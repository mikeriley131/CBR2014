ISSUES:
- header logo "halo" background is cropped in PSD comp so you see the hard left edge on the site
- Firefox: barely visible gap between grey and blue nav bars at top of page
- Firefox: primary nav bar "hangs" over section below on secondary pages with no header image

NOTES:
- don't know where "Watch Video" link on KiPOW! page should go to
- I don't have anything that will allow me to test in IE
