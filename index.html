				<h1>We Stand for Children.</h1>
				<p>Children’s National is dedicated to fulfilling its vision of setting the standard in excellence in pediatric care, advocacy, research, and education, here in the nation’s capital, around the country, and throughout the world. </p>
				<p>This Community Benefit Report highlights a few of the many programs that, in 2013, were of great benefit to their communities, and were instrumental in helping Children’s National address several priority areas – asthma, obesity, oral health, and sexual health. These programs include the:</p>
				<div class="column">
					<h2 class="kipow">Heart Health Learning Power Collaborative (KiPOW!)</h2>
					<p>A partnership with George Washington University Medical School and DC Public and Public Charter Schools, that aims to improve child health by promoting adherence to the DC Healthy Schools Act, a landmark school wellness policy in close alignment with evidence-based pediatric obesity prevention guidelines. KiPOW is a mentored behavioral change model in which medical students not only talk about nutrition and physical activity; they also eat lunch with students and play together at recess. Improvement post-intervention in health literacy, blood pressure, and fitness scores in our pilot elementary schools predict a promising future for this program.</p>
					<h2 class="macche">Mid-Atlantic Center for Children’s Health and the Environment (MACCHE)</h2>
					<p>One of ten Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units in the U.S. that provides educational programs and consultation on the impact of the environment on children’s health. During the fiscal year 2013, MACCHE held several trainings on such topics as environmental management of pediatric asthma and the effects of climate change on allergy and asthma, including an intensive half-day workshop for 80 nurses in the region.</p>
					<h2 class="teen-life">Teen Life Clubs</h2>
					<p>An adolescent health and development program whose goal is to reduce sexual risk through after-school courses and activities, and stress sound decision-making skills and responsible life choices. This popular program, that served 44 youth in 2013, boasts a long list of community partners, including universities, youth sports and recreation programs, and numerous health advocacy groups.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h2 class="ped-oral">DC Pediatric Oral Health Coalition</h2>
					<p>A multi-disciplinary, community coalition comprised of stakeholders with insight and passion for improving the state of pediatric oral health in the District, this three-year program is now entering the implementation phase of its work. In 2013, this included securing Medicaid approval of coding procedures that allow dentists and primary care providers to bill and be reimbursed for fluoride varnish application and creation of a streamlined and multi-lingual oral health assessment form.</p>
					<h2 class="student">Student Innovators Program</h2>
					<p>An eight-week internship program that last year brought 31 science students from all corners of the globe to Children’s National to study innovation theory and practice and design projects to impact the future of medical technology and healthcare.</p>
					<h2 class="nurses">Nurses in the Community (Parish Nursing Program and Magnet&copy; Champions Cereal Drive)</h2>
					<p>Nurses uniquely influence all aspects of health. Their clinical judgment and experience, and professional and personal instinct offer a unique perspective on preventing illness and injury, alleviating suffering, and advocating for individuals, families, communities, and populations. Two outreach programs at Children’s National exemplify the breadth, scope, and reach of these nursing efforts.</p>
