						<p>Today, hospitals like many of society’s traditional systems of support, must stretch and even bend to meet the increasingly complex and changing needs of the communities it serves. Confronting the current social, economic, and political factors that impact children’s health requires a bold vision – a willingness to challenge the status quo, encourage unconventional approaches, and set ambitious goals. At Children’s National, we work each day to reach our vision of setting the standard in excellence in pediatric care, advocacy, research, and education. And in doing so, we stand for children not only in communities across the nation’s capital, but around the country, and throughout the world.</p>
						<p>This report highlights a few of the programs in 2013 that were of great benefit to these communities, and were instrumental in helping Children’s National address several key priority areas – asthma, obesity, oral health, and sexual health. As you read, you will see that their accomplishments speak for themselves, as does the commitment and dedication of our community partners – without whom much of this important work simply would not be possible. Through these and numerous other community-based programs and activities, Children’s National strives to improve the health of children, their families and communities, and inspire others to join us in standing for children everywhere.</p>
						<p>Sincerely,</p>

						President and Chief Executive Officer</p>
