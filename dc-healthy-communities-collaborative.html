				<p>The District of Columbia Healthy Communities Collaborative (DCHCC) – an alliance of DC hospitals and community health centers dedicated to proactively addressing the health needs of DC residents through shared resources, expertise, and accountability – was hard at work in 2013 putting more than a year of research and planning into action. The year brought the conclusion of the research phase of the Collaborative’s work, an exhaustive needs assessment commissioned by the group and conducted by The Rand Corporation. The assessment identified four issues as top community health priorities: sexual health; mental health and substance abuse; obesity/overweight; and asthma. Armed with these results, the group then incorporated these findings from focus groups held within the needs assessment process as well as obtaining input from community members via a community specific forum to develop a comprehensive Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). The CHIP is a collaboration-driven, forward-looking three-year blueprint for improving the city’s health. The plan takes into consideration the city’s unique strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities and the Collaborative members’ collective capacity in an effort to identify the specific goals and objectives, approaches and strategic levers, community resources, and critical partners needed to effectively address each priority health issue.</p>
				<p>The end of the fiscal year brought the formal kick-off of DC Health Matters, an online portal of community health information, during a ceremony featuring the country’s Chief Technology Officer, Todd Park, who stressed the importance of data in advancing the concept of population health.</p>
				<p>Now in the implementation phase of the CHIP, the Collaborative is working to realize its vision for the first priority area; that is, to ensure the integration of preventative services related to sexual health into primary care, ambulatory and other community-based services by the year 2016. The Collaborative’s most immediate goals in this area include advocating for incorporation of routine screenings for sexually transmitted infections in primary care settings, and strengthening partnerships related to maternal and infant health. To fulfill its commitment to accountability and transparency, the DCHCC uses DC Health Matters, to keep the public fully-informed. In fact, both the needs assessment findings and CHIP are currently posted on this site (http://www.dchealthmatters.org), as are community health statistics, promising practices, resources and funding opportunities, and ways to become active in the local health initiatives. In the coming months, visitors to the site will be able to track milestones as the Collaborative’s work continues on these important issues.</p>
