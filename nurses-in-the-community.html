				<h1 class="nurses">Nurses in the Community</h1>
				<p>Nurses uniquely influence all aspects of health. Their clinical judgment and experience, and professional and personal instinct offer a unique perspective on preventing illness and injury, alleviating suffering, and advocating for individuals, families, communities, and populations. Two outreach programs at Children’s National exemplify the breadth, scope, and reach of these nursing efforts.</p>
				<h2 class="nurses">Parish Nursing Program</h2>
				<p>The Parish Nursing Program is part of a wide spread movement that combines the specialized practice of professional nursing with the spiritual process and power of healing and whole person health. The program works with faith community leaders to plan and implement health promotion and injury prevention programs targeting children and young adults. In 2013, parish nurses collaborated with health ministries across the city to raise awareness and educate families on childhood illnesses and the prevention of disease in a variety of venues – from church events and community health fairs and festivals, to parent meetings and speaking engagements. An active advisory council assists program managers in setting policy and establishing procedures, and with program assessment, planning, and evaluation.</p>
				<h2 class="nurses">Magnet<sup>&copy;</sup> Champions Cereal Drive</h2>
				<p>Making sure kids eat when school breakfast programs end for the summer is the goal for the Children’s National nurses who take part in the Magnet<sup>&copy;</sup> Champions Cereal Drive. The drive is part of a collaborative of 11 pediatric hospitals across the country. The Magnet<sup>&copy;</sup> Champions begin preparing in the early spring to promote the drive throughout the health system. The Magnet<sup>&copy;</sup> Champions collect, organize, and work with the Capital Area Food Bank and other community partners to make sure donations reach disadvantaged children who may miss breakfast because school is out for summer. In 2013, the Magnet<sup>&copy;</sup> Champions Cereal Drive provided an impressive 9,389 servings of cereal to area children who might have otherwise missed a meal.</p>
