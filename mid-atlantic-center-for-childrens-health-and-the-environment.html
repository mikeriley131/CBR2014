				<p>Environmental toxins are all around us. This is an unfortunate reality of modern life. Children who are routinely exposed to environmental toxins where they live and play are particularly susceptible to the adverse health outcomes associated with environmental exposures because their bodies are still developing. Critical to recognizing, preventing, and treating children exposed to harmful substances and environments are well-trained health professionals. Located at Children’s National, the Mid-Atlantic Center for Children’s Health and the Environment (MACCHE), is one of ten Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSUs) in the U.S. which serves the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. MACCHE provides educational programs and consultation to health professionals, parents, caregivers, and concerned citizens about the impact of the environment on children’s health.</p>
				<p>Asthma, one of the most serious environmental health threats to children, was the focus of several trainings requested last year by medical and health-related organizations. Along with presenting on such topics as environmental management of pediatric asthma and the effects of climate change on allergy and asthma, MACCHE professionals held an intensive, half-day education and training session with the Delaware Nurses Association. Eighty nurses participated in the workshops which examined the full-range of issues around asthma prevention and control, including environmental contributors, such as tobacco smoke and chemicals, hazards in the home, and best practices for integrating screenings into practice visits. In addition to asthma education, in 2013 MACCHE provided and/or sponsored: 68 educational events for 2,379 participants on unconventional gas extraction, lead poisoning, school health, and a host of other important environmental health issues; 90 no-cost consultations to a mix of parents, caregivers, patients, and community members, and convened a successful day-long Conference on Environmental Health for Obstetricians and Gynecologists with the George Washington University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for faculty and residents of academic medical programs in the Mid-Atlantic.</p>
