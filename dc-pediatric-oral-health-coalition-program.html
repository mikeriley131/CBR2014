				<h1 class="ped-oral">DC Pediatric Oral Health Coalition Program</h1>
				<p>In the three years since the DC Pediatric Oral Health Coalition was formed, intense planning has laid the groundwork for meaningful improvement in oral health access and care for children throughout the District of Columbia. Now, with Children’s National still the facilitative leader of this multi-disciplinary public/private partnership, the implementation phase is off to an impactful and historic start.</p>
				<p>In the areas of medical and dental collaboration and regulatory and policy change, an amended DC Medicaid State Plan and coding procedure now allows dentists and primary care providers to bill and be reimbursed for fluoride varnish application. The Coalition’s goal of creating a streamlined, multi-lingual school oral health assessment form also was realized in 2013. The form, which has been included in the enrollment package for school year 2014-2015, is an important milestone in efforts to improve access to information and data sharing between the school system, providers, and families. Looking forward, the coalition will provide fluoride varnish application training to primary care physicians beginning in fiscal year 2014, work to establish a tracking mechanism for fluoride varnish provision in 2014, which will be accomplished through the use of the city’s web-based Immunization Registry, and provide technical assistance for the incorporation of fluoride varnish application into clinical settings.</p>
