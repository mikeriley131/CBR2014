				<h1 class="student">Student Innovators Program</h1>
				<p>Innovation – and the scientific, technological, and organizational skills it takes to support it – requires the ingenuity of a generation’s most talented and progressive minds. Since 2011, Children’s National, through its Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation, has nurtured that spirit through its Student Innovators Summer Program – a unique, highly specialized summer internship opportunity for both domestic and international graduate, medical, undergraduate, and advanced high schools students interested in studying medicine or conducting advanced work in the sciences. For eight weeks, students, with mentors from across medical disciplines, blend theory with practice to design projects based on current research in bioengineering, surgical issues, medicine, biological sciences, and innovation management. Workshops focus on creativity, brainstorming, team-building, intellectual property and product development, and students are provided with opportunities to observe surgeries, shadow clinicians, and attend clinics.</p>
				<p>Always searching for creative ways to teach the concept of “innovation,” program planners and mentors in 2013 shifted from multi-day, formal student workshops, to longer, more intense and hands-on sessions, referred to in clinical settings as medical hackathons. The idea of a “hackathon” is to bring together novices to “hack” away at a problem with the goal of developing one or more creative solutions. The challenge for last year’s student innovators was to partner with the hospital’s Improving Diet, Energy and Activity for Life (IDEAL) Clinic to create a tool that could effectively address the problem of childhood obesity. What emerged was a mobile app specially designed to, among other features, facilitate communication between clinic patients and with providers, and to help with dietary management. To date, the app has received institutional review board approval to collect data, as well as funding through a small grant to continue concept development. What’s more, the hackathon, having gone “viral” on social media, has resulted in a record-breaking number of applications to the program for 2014. Other areas explored last year by student innovators were equally as impressive, and were diverse in subject area, too, including research on the development of new medications to treat inflammatory diseases, interface devices for pediatric patients with cerebral palsy, and ways to improve long-term surgical outcomes in tissue-engineered vascular grafts.</p>
