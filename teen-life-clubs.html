				<h1 class="teen-life">Teen Life Clubs</h1>
				<p>A signature program within the Adolescent Prevention Education Program, Teen Life Clubs and their focus on improving the decision-making skills of 11-14 year olds has become a staple in communities throughout the District of Columbia. Its primary objectives to encourage goal-setting, responsible choices, and developing healthy relationships have all proven to be important factors in reducing teen sexual activity and pregnancy.</p>
				<p>The twenty-six lesson curriculum, delivered by trained adult instructors in schools, recreation centers, clinics, and other community settings, is divided into four units on self-awareness and identity; healthy bodies; violence prevention; and money matters. Forty four youth benefited from participating in the popular clubs last year thanks to partnerships with a diverse group of partners, including Howard, American, and Georgetown Universities, the Junior League of Washington, and LEGACY. Evaluation research is made possible by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education for the District of Columbia (OSSE) and will continue to measure the effectiveness of the programs’ curriculum and activities at reducing risks related to STDs, HIV, and unplanned pregnancy.</p>
